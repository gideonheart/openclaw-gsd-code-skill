# gsd-code-skill

v4.0 event-driven architecture. Each Claude Code hook event has its own folder under `events/` containing a Node.js handler and a prompt template. A shared Node.js library in `lib/` provides common utilities. No bash hook scripts — bash is only used where tmux interaction requires it.

## Scripts

- `bin/hook-event-logger.sh` — Universal debug logger for all Claude Code hook events. Reads stdin JSON payload and writes structured entries to per-session log files. Self-contained bootstrapping with no external library dependencies.

## Configuration

- `config/agent-registry.json` — Agent registry mapping agent IDs to session config, working directories, and tmux session names
