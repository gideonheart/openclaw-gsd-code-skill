## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stop hook over polling: Event-driven is more precise, lower overhead, enables intelligent decisions
- Per-agent system prompts in registry: Different agents need different personalities/constraints
- Delete autoresponder + hook-watcher: Replaced by Stop hook; keeping both creates confusion
