This Claude Code session uses the GSD (Get Shit Done) workflow for project management.

GSD Workflow Commands:
- /gsd:resume-work - Resume work on the current project or phase
- /gsd:new-project - Initialize a new project with PRD and roadmap
- /gsd:help - Show available GSD commands and workflow guidance
- /gsd:execute-plan - Execute a specific plan from the roadmap
- /gsd:research-phase - Research and gather context for a phase

Context Management:
- /clear - Clear conversation context to free up space
- /compact - Compact context to reduce token usage
- /resume - Resume from a saved conversation state

When uncertain about the workflow or next steps, use /gsd:help for guidance.
The GSD workflow provides structured project execution with phases, plans, and atomic commits.
